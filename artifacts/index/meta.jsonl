These Medicaid-eligible households must submit Form H3038-P , CHIP Perinatal — Emergency Medical Services Certification, to apply for Emergency Medicaid to pay for these charges.  A woman certified for TA 85 with household income above the TP40 income limit cannot be certified for Emergency Medicaid to cover the labor with delivery charges.\nA child born to a CHIP perinatal mother whose household income is at or below the income limit for TP40 and who receives Emergency Medicaid to cover labor with delivery charges is enrolled in Medicaid instead of CHIP perinatal.\nThirty days before the expected due date, TIERS generates and sends Form H3038-P with Form H1061 , Birth Outcome Letter, to the household. If the household has not reported the child’s birth by 30 days after the expected due date, TIERS sends a Form H1062 , Birth Outcome Reminder Letter, and a second Form H3038-P with instructions for getting Form H3038-P completed and signed by the medical practitioner, along with a self-addressed postage-paid envelope. The household must return Form H3038-P to HHSC.\nUpon receipt of Form H3038-P:\nthe form is linked to the mother's case; and\na task is created for Customer Care Center (CCC) staff to certify the mother for Emergency Medicaid and the newborn for TP 45.\nStaff must not certify the mother for Emergency Medicaid or the newborn for TP 45 if the household has not returned Form H3038-P within 60 days from the date of the expected pregnancy due date. Reopen three-month prior applications for people who return Form H3038-P after 60 days from the expected pregnancy due date.\nNote: For newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), process both the Emergency Medicaid coverage for the mother and the TP 45 for the newborn.\nCCC Staff Process\nCCC is assigned a task to process Form H3038-P. Staff must:\ndetermine whether mother and newborn are already active on Medicaid;\nif mother and newborn are not active on Medicaid, use all TP 40 eligibility policies and procedures to determine Emergency Medicaid eligibility, except when verifying income and citizenship/alien status;\nuse the verified income provided to determine CHIP perinatal eligibility to determine Emergency Medicaid eligibility. Note: TIERS will not run financial rules when certifying a recipient for Emergency Medicaid and will instead use the verified income used to determine the woman’s CHIP Perinatal eligibility;\nverify all non-financial eligibility points prior to certification using: identity verification sources; and residence verification sources;\nidentity verification sources; and\nresidence verification sources;\nuse the date Form H3038-P is received as the file date for the Emergency Medicaid and TP 45; and\nprocess Form H3038-P by the 45th date after the file date.\nThe file date for the TP 45 is usually the date Form H3038-P is received if it includes the newborn's information. Birth outcome information can also be received via the newborn interface or from the person by phone or in writing. When birth outcome information is received after Form H3038-P has already been submitted to the HHSC, a second task is assigned to CCC to process TP 45 coverage for the newborn.\nWhen CCC staff receive a task that includes Form H3038-P dated more than 60 days after the pregnancy due date, CCC must stamp \"Received (Date) CCC\" on Form H3038-P, to indicate the form was provided after the 60 days from the pregnancy due date. CCC staff must return Form H3038-P along with an application and a letter informing the person that they must apply for Medicaid. The person is instructed to complete the application and return it to the nearest HHSC office or appropriate out-stationed worker, if an out-stationed worker is housed at the hospital where the delivery took place.\nOut-Stationed and HHSC Eligibility Office Staff Process\nThe chart below explains procedures staff must follow to determine appropriate action.\ncertify the TP 36 coverage when determining eligibility for the other requested programs (including TP 45) following existing policy, if eligible; or\nfax only Form H3038-P to 877-447-2839 if the mother is ineligible for Emergency Medicaid based on the current information.\nNotes:\nFax the bar-coded Form H3038-P to 877-447-2839. If Form H3038-P is not bar-coded, write the mother's case and CHIP perinatal EDG number on the top of the form.\nIf the applicant requests the fax number for Form H3038-P, instruct the applicant to fax the form to 877-447-2839 .\nRelated Policy\nReceipt of Duplicate Application, A-121.2 Receipt of Identical Application, A-121.3 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Process, A-126.3.1 Verification Sources, A-621 Verification Sources, A-761 Reopening Three Months Prior Applications, A-831.2.1 Deadlines, B-112"}

For example:\nA child aging out of TP 48 is automatically tested for TP 44.\nA non-parent child determined ineligible because of aging out of TP 44 is referred to the Marketplace.\nThe system does not terminate eligibility for the people listed above at the end of the certification period. Staff act to review the person’s eligibility and re-run the hierarchy to determine potential eligibility for other programs. Staff must use the first day of the last month of the current certification period as the file date. Staff should process the EDGs like a redetermination, without requiring a renewal form. Except in the case of TP 40, where there may be an application, staff process the EDG as they do redeterminations with renewal forms. Staff must verify information the way it is done in the redetermination process.\nDo not re-evaluate the remaining people in the recipient’s household composition for eligibility during a continuous eligibility period. Changes to household composition such as a minor parent aging out, the end of a pregnancy, or the termination of Transitional Medicaid coverage, must be addressed once the person is no longer eligible for a program with 12-month continuous eligibility. This includes Children’s Medicaid (TP 44), Pregnant Women (TP 40), or Transitional Medicaid programs (TP 07 and TP 20). Once the continuous eligibility period ends, staff must re-evaluate the recipient’s eligibility for all appropriate Medicaid or MSP and transfer coverage, if eligible, without requiring a new application.\nNote: An interview is required when testing for TP 08.\nRelated Policy\nGeneral Information for Denials and Terminations, A-116.1 Medical Programs Hierarchy, A-132.1"}
