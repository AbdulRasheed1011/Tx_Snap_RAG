E-2210, HOW TO REPORT A CHANGE
Printer-friendly version
Revision 15-4; Effective October 1, 2015
Customer Care Center (CCC) staff process all changes for Former Foster Care Children (FFCC) recipients. FFCC recipients can report changes:
online through YourTexasBenefits.com ;
by visiting a local eligibility office;
in writing by mail or fax;
by completing Form H1019 , Report of Change; or
by calling 2-1-1.
Note: When a change is reported by telephone, staff must verify that the person speaking is the individual or an authorized representative as explained in A-2000 , Identifying Applicants Interviewed by Phone and Prevention of Duplicate Participation.
An individual must report the following changes:
if the individual moves out state,
an address change, or
enrollment in health insurance.
Advisors process all other changes, including agency-generated changes, at the next renewal.
Exception: If the individual failed to report required information at the time of the application that causes the individual to be ineligible for FFCC, advisors must deny the benefits and send a fraud referral to the Office of the Inspector General.
