B-620, REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Printer-friendly version
Revision 24-3; Effective July 1, 2024
ALL PROGRAMS
During the certification period, households must report specific information based on the type of assistance and their household circumstances. Send Form H1019, Report of Change, to inform households of their reporting requirements.
B-621 WHAT TO REPORT
Revision 24-3; Effective July 1, 2024
TANF
Inform all certified households of their responsibility to report changes in:
physical address;
the source of earned and unearned income;
the amount of non-exempt unearned income of any household member;
household composition;
ownership of a licensed vehicle;
wage rate or employment status, meaning full-time or part-time as defined by the employer, for employed household members;
available cash, stocks, bonds, or money in a bank or savings account if the total is above $1,000;
address, job, or other information about the absent parent;
citizenship or immigration status; and
circumstances other than employment that affect a person's benefit amount or employment services exemption status.
SNAP
Streamlined reporting (SR) minimizes the information that households must report during the certification period to maintain their benefit level and eligibility. Households are assigned an SR designation at application and redetermination. Both SR 1 and SR 2 households are subject to SR criteria. SR 3 households are not subject to SR criteria. At application and redetermination, inform all households of the changes they must report based on their SR designation. The household’s SR designation does not alter the change reporting requirements for associated medical program(s) or TANF benefits.
Although SR households are only required to report changes based on their SR designation, staff must take appropriate action on any household reported changes and all agency-generated changes regardless of the SR designation.
SR 1 HOUSEHOLDS
Inform SR 1 households of their responsibility to report changes in:
income when ongoing gross monthly income goes above 130 percent of the FPL for two consecutive months;
work or participation hours of an able-bodied adult without dependents (ABAWD) if their hours decrease to below an average of 20 hours per week; and
lottery or gambling winnings of more than $4,250.
SR 2 HOUSEHOLDS
Inform SR 2 households of their responsibility to report changes in:
income if ongoing gross monthly income remains above 130 percent of the FPL for the household's size for two consecutive months;
work or participation hours of an ABAWD if their hours decrease to below an average of 20 hours per week; and
lottery or gambling winnings of more than $4,250.
Note: SR 2 households are not required to report changes in ongoing gross monthly income below 130 percent of the FPL for the household size.
SR 3 HOUSEHOLDS
Inform SR 3 households of their responsibility to report changes in:
physical address and associated changes in shelter costs, such as rent or mortgage and utilities;
source of earned and unearned income;
legal obligation of child support paid to or for a person outside the household;
household composition;
ownership of a licensed vehicle;
wage rate or employment status meaning full-time or part-time as defined by the employer, for employed household members;
gross monthly household unearned income if the amount changes by more than $125 during the certification period;
available cash, stocks, bonds or money in a bank or savings account if the combined resources total $5,000 or more;
work or participation hours of an ABAWD if their hours decrease to below an average of 20 hours per week; and
lottery or gambling winnings of more than $4,250.
MEDICAL PROGRAMS EXCEPT TP 45
Inform all households of their responsibility to report changes in:
physical address;
intent to live in Texas;
the people living in the home;
income, including sources of income, regular hours worked and pay rate;
Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) expenses;
a child being institutionalized or dying; and
medical insurance coverage.
Households are not required to report a change in tax status or tax relationship during the certification period because tax status and tax relationships are self-declared based on what the household expects to happen on their federal income taxes.
TP 08 AND TA 31
Inform all households of their responsibility to report changes in physical address, job or other information related to the absent parent.
CHILDREN ON TP 56 AND TP 32
Inform all households of their responsibility to report changes in available cash, stocks, bonds, or money in a bank or savings account if the total is over:
$3,000 in households with a member who is aged or has a disability and meets relationship requirements; or
$2,000 for all other households.
TP 40
Inform all households of their responsibility to report the termination of a pregnancy.
TP 45
Inform all households of their responsibility to report if the child no longer lives in Texas.
